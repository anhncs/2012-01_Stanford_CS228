function [Beta sigma] = FitLinearGaussianParameters(X, U)

% Estimate parameters of the linear Gaussian model:
% X|U ~ N(Beta(1)*U(1) + ... + Beta(n)*U(n) + Beta(n+1), sigma^2);

% Note that Matlab/Octave index from 1, we can't write Beta(0).
% So Beta(n+1) is essentially Beta(0) in the text book.

% X: (M x 1), the child variable, M examples
% U: (M x N), N parent variables, M examples

M = size(U,1);
N = size(U,2);

Beta = zeros(N+1,1);
sigma = 1;

% collect expectations and solve the linear system
% A = [ E[U(1)],      E[U(2)],      ... , E[U(n)],      1     ; 
%       E[U(1)*U(1)], E[U(2)*U(1)], ... , E[U(n)*U(1)], E[U(1)];
%       ...         , ...         , ... , ...         , ...   ;
%       E[U(1)*U(n)], E[U(2)*U(n)], ... , E[U(n)*U(n)], E[U(n)] ]
