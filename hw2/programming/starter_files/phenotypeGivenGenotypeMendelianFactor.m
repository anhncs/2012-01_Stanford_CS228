function phenotypeFactor = phenotypeGivenGenotypeMendelianFactor(isDominant, genotypeVar, phenotypeVar)
% This function computes the probability of each phenotype given the
% different genotypes for a trait.  It assumes that there is 1 dominant
% allele and 1 recessive allele.
%
% For the genotypes, assignment 1 maps to homozygous dominant, assignment 2
% maps to heterozygous, and assignment 3 maps to homozygous recessive.  For
% the phenotypes, assignment 1 maps to having the physical trait, and
% assignment 2 maps to not having the physical trait.
%
% THE VARIABLE TO THE LEFT OF THE CONDITIONING BAR MUST BE THE FIRST
% VARIABLE IN THE .var FIELD FOR GRADING PURPOSES
%
% Input:
%   isDominant: 1 if the trait is caused by the dominant allele (trait 
%   would be caused by A in example above) and 0 if the trait is caused by
%   the recessive allele (trait would be caused by a in the example above)
%   genotypeVar: The variable number for the genotype variable
%   phenotypeVar: The variable number for the phenotype variable
%
% Output:
%   phenotypeFactor: Factor denoting the probability of having each 
%   phenotype for each genotype
