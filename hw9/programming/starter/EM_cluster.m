function [P loglikelihood ClassProb] = EM_cluster(poseData, G, InitialClassProb, maxIter)

% INPUTS
% poseData: N x 10 x 3 matrix, where N is number of poses;
%   poseData(i,:,:) yields the 10x3 matrix for pose i.
% G: graph parameterization as explained in PA8
% InitialClassProb: N x K, initial allocation of the N poses to the K
%   classes. InitialClassProb(i,j) is the probability that example i belongs
%   to class j
% maxIter: max number of iterations to run EM

% OUTPUTS
% P: structure holding the learned parameters as described in the PA
% loglikelihood: #(iterations run) x 1 vector of loglikelihoods stored for
%   each iteration
% ClassProb: N x K, conditional class probability of the N examples to the
%   K classes in the final iteration. ClassProb(i,j) is the probability that
%   example i belongs to class j

% Initialize variables
N = size(poseData, 1);
K = size(InitialClassProb, 2);

ClassProb = InitialClassProb;

loglikelihood = zeros(maxIter,1);

  % M-STEP to estimate parameters for Gaussians

  % Fill in P.c with the estimates for prior class probabilities
  % Fill in P.clg for each body part and each class
  % Make sure to choose the right parameterization based on G(i,1)
  %
  % Hint: This part should be similar to your work from PA8

  % E-STEP to re-estimate ClassProb using the new parameters
  %
  % Update ClassProb with the new conditional class probabilities.
  % Recall that ClassProb(i,j) is the probability that example i belongs to
  % class j.
  %
  % You should compute everything in log space, and only convert to
  % probability space at the end.
  %
  % Tip: To make things faster, try to reduce the number of calls to
  % lognormpdf, and inline the function (i.e., copy the lognormpdf code
  % into this file)
  %
  % Hint: You should use the logsumexp() function here to do
  % probability normalization in log space to avoid numerical issues
  
  ClassProb = zeros(N,K);
