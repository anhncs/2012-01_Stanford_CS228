function [P loglikelihood ClassProb PairProb] = EM_HMM(actionData, poseData, G, InitialClassProb, InitialPairProb, maxIter)

% INPUTS
% actionData: structure holding the actions as described in the PA
% poseData: N x 10 x 3 matrix, where N is number of poses in all actions
% G: graph parameterization as explained in PA description
% InitialClassProb: N x K matrix, initial allocation of the N poses to the K
%   states. InitialClassProb(i,j) is the probability that example i belongs
%   to state j.
%   This is described in more detail in the PA.
% InitialPairProb: V x K^2 matrix, where V is the total number of pose
%   transitions in all HMM action models, and K is the number of states.
%   This is described in more detail in the PA.
% maxIter: max number of iterations to run EM

% OUTPUTS
% P: structure holding the learned parameters as described in the PA
% loglikelihood: #(iterations run) x 1 vector of loglikelihoods stored for
%   each iteration
% ClassProb: N x K matrix of the conditional class probability of the N examples to the
%   K states in the final iteration. ClassProb(i,j) is the probability that
%   example i belongs to state j. This is described in more detail in the PA.
% PairProb: V x K^2 matrix, where V is the total number of pose transitions
%   in all HMM action models, and K is the number of states. This is
%   described in more detail in the PA.
